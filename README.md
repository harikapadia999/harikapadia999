# Greetings according to your time zone!

I am _Hari Kapadia_, a Master of Science in Information Technology graduate from DA-IICT, Gandhinagar. With a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming, I’ve grown from a casual programmer into a confident full-stack developer, comfortable solving real-world problems through clean, scalable code.
⚡ I am involved in a lot of *organizational works* in college related to clubs, hackathons, fests, workshops, and helped in building many communities from scratch.


### 🌱 What do I do and What have I done? 

- I’ve worked with startups and businesses to build online applications — from the frontend to the backend — always aiming for better performance, streamlined user experiences, and visually appealing design.
- I'm constantly learning new tools and frameworks to stay current and push my skills further, whether it’s for web, hybrid app development, or AI.
- Lately, I’ve been diving into the world of AI — building chatbots, automation agents, and LLM-integrated tools that combine intelligent behavior with smooth user interfaces.
- Exploring how AI can improve everyday workflows has become an exciting area of focus for me.
- Having led teams during academic and project-based work, I enjoy working with people, sharing ideas, and making sure things get done — together.
- I'm always open to discussing programming techniques, system design, AI workflows, or the latest in web and app development. And if there’s something I haven’t learned yet — I pick it up fast.
- My focus is on writing clean, DRY code, and following best practices to build software that’s reliable, maintainable, and built for the long term.
